01.09.18 v1.0.1
	Added saveVersion to reactor save file.
	Modifications to saving, savefile size is about a quarter of what it used to be.
	Saves are incompatible between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1, sorry! I'll do my best to keep the compatibility going forward.
	Fixed column alignment for stats display in-app and PNG-exported.
	Added exact placement error display for invalid cooler blocks (mostly for debugging but it's still useful).
	Massive reworks to drawing methods and texture handling.
	More tweaks to tooltip behaviour.
	Added autonaming when saving reactors, it's %FuelName% %SizeX% x %SizeY% x %SizeZ% is you're saving a new reactor and %OldName% if you're editing a loaded save. Works for PNG export as well and for both single-layer and entire-reactor modes.

02.09.18 v1.0.2
	Added build version to the app's title
	Fixed autonaming when saving PNG
	Further reworked saving in preparation for implementing value configurations. (Still loads previous version's savefiles yay!)

02.09.18 v1.0.3
	Made BIG BOI OPTIMIZATIONS and refactored rendering.
	Fixed a bunch of typos and capitalization inconsistencies in cooler descriptions.
	Prepared everything for implementing layer menus, those and block value configurations are next on the list.
	Finally fixed a memory leak that was the #1 reason for the app crashing! Now you should be completely save to edit any reactors the app allows you to create.
	The grid doesn't update properly if you're drag-drawing and release your mouse outside of any layers. This is a known minor bug as you can refresh it by clicking inside the layer, changing viewmode, changing displayed layer etc. So just try to keep your mouse inside the layers when drawing and it'll work perfectly.
	Fixed a bug where exporting as PNG wouldn't draw the error rectangles over invalid coolers.

03.09.18 v1.1.0
	Implemented custom general, cooling and fuel values! Check out the new settings window. These do not persist over sessions though, haven't fixed it yet.

04.09.18 v1.1.1
	Migrated to JSON storage format for savefiles. MASSIVE decrease in savefile sizes. Old format can still be loaded (change the filter when selecting files) but you can only save in JSON from now on.
	Fixed a display bug for heating values in stats.
	Reworked the saving \ loading methods and the save autonaming system.
	Added my credentials and a short description to the assembly info. :^)
	Refactored cooler placement checking.
	Uploaded the code to GitHub!
--Important!--
	From this point on you'll need to have Newtonsoft.json.dll by the executable as it is a reference. I've included the download on mediafire (Unless i'm blind their license allows reuploading so it's all good.)

06.09.18 v1.1.2
	Finished cooler placement checking refactoring in preparation for rendering changes.
	Updated Diamond cooler rules to 2.11b rules (one Water and one Quartz).
	
07.09.18 v1.1.3
	Migrated configuration saving so json, you can now have any number of configuration files and load them into the application as needed.
	The app now initially starts with a blank 5x5x5 reactor open.
	Added a warning when there's no json.NET dll present.
	Default setting values are now NuclearCraft 2.11c vanilla ones.
	Reordered the stats output.
	Shuffled around the UI a bit.
	
07.09.18 v1.1.4
	More tooltip fixes, hopefully gotten rid of all their display bugs.
	The app now generates a default configuration file that's loaded on startup. Overwrite it to have your custom settings persist between launches.
	Added effective energy generation and meltdown time to the stats. (Thanks to Jox+Snarklord for the formulas.)
	Added used fuel to PNG export.
	
07.09.18 v1.2.0
	Added a menustrip to each layer to reduce UI clutter, new layer manipulation features are going in there.
	Implemented layer clearing, copying and pasting!
	The Management tab is a placeholder and doesn't do anything yet.
12.09.18 v1.2.0
	Implemented the management tab, you can now delete and insert layers!

15.09.18 v1.2.1
	This is a "Hot"fix (a week late ugh).
	Fixed a bug with moderator multipliers, i was using the full config value instead of 1/6.
	Added layer numbers to individual layers in layer menus.
	Resource Costs tab is WIP please ignore it for now :P.

15.09.18 v1.2.2
	Fixed moderators not saving properly and reverting to Beryllium regardless of type.

19.09.18 v1.2.3
	Fixed a bug with layer modification when inserting a layer.
	Changed the way Enderium placement validity is checked.

21.09.18 v1.2.4
	Fixed a bug with palette tooltips not updating on config changes.
	Fixed a typo in "HELP-239 Oxide" fuel and related save\loading.
	Fixed used fuel not loading when loading a reactor savefile.
	Fixed fuels not loading with config files.

03.01.19 v1.2.5
	Added nuclearcraft configuration file parsing - Anoyomouse
	Added realtime configuration textbox validation - Anoyomouse

04.01.19 v1.2.6
	Fixed https://github.com/hellrage/NC-Reactor-Planner/issues/1

04.01.19 v1.2.7
	Fixed image export only drawing the current layer for extra large reactors.
	Fixed a crash with extra large reactors.

04.01.19 v1.2.8
	Fixed a bug with inserting layers creating invalid casings.
	Improved tooltip behaviour AGAIN.

09.01.19 v1.2.9
	Fix for decimal delimeter - Anoyomouse
